The following repo is composed of various C code I am playing around with in order to improve my C coding skills.

If you wish to use them, I highly recommend you compile them yourself. This is typically done on the command line by typing:

gcc 1.c -o theprogram

where:
* 1.c is the c code to be compiled
* -o indicates to compile with a program name. If you omit this then a.out is the program. I believe this to be undesirable, but maybe it is not.
* theprogram is the name of the compiled code. It could be anything you want.
